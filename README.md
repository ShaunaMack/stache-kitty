# Stache kitty

There is a picture of a cute cat, and a moustache.

Our task is to

1. log the position of the mouse cursor
2. implement an event listener that will put the moustache where the user clicks, so you can give the cute cat a moustache
3. rotate the moustache so it looks good on the kitty
4. add a caption under the image of the kitty
5. add thought bubbles where we click
6. add a control panel to enlarge, shrink and rotate the moustache

Then we will add a caption

### Some tips:

- Two event properties that will help here are _pageX_ and _pageY_. These return coordinates of the mouse. Use console.log to see what is returned.
